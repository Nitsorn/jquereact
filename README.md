Just a page in an app im building | http://www.optimate.me/

- replicating React data-flow and component-based life-cycles
- replicating React setState and rerenders

To see the demo: http://www.optimate.me/ and sign in. This file is for the root component after authentication.

I was planning on building a full React app, and decided to work with jQuery for now. Thought it would be fun to try to immitate React in jQuery.


Todo:

- Componentialize this page
- Export as class
- Pass props in and out
- Deal with prop changes
